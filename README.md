This a a hangman game, limited number of choices to guess each word, using javascript.  It is almost finished, it still needs to remove each animal as it is saved, add whitespace for the multi-words in level 3, and get smoother transitions between completed words, and level 1 needs to start at wins: 0.  Currently working on improvements.
